      <description>A few weeks ago, i decided to install Endeavour OS, an Arch Linux based distro, on my laptop. I was bored of Kubuntu, and it had issues with my CPU since it was not well supported by the LTS kernel. In general, i also prefer getting updates faster. All of this made me want to switch to a rolling release distro.
The first distro that i tried to install was Manjaro, it was everything i wanted, however, the installer would freeze, something that holded me back from trying it (it did work on a VM).</description>
