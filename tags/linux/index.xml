      <description>In this post, i will show you some Linux basics and a little bit about Kubuntu. Kubuntu is a Linux distribution that is basically Ubuntu but with KDE Plasma as the desktop environment (like a GUI). I&amp;rsquo;d like to thank Zera since he wanted me to make a post about some debian based distro.
Installation The Kubuntu installation is pretty straight forward, you go to the Kubuntu Website and you download the latest LTS version.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago, i decided to install Endeavour OS, an Arch Linux based distro, on my laptop. I was bored of Kubuntu, and it had issues with my CPU since it was not well supported by the LTS kernel. In general, i also prefer getting updates faster. All of this made me want to switch to a rolling release distro.
The first distro that i tried to install was Manjaro, it was everything i wanted, however, the installer would freeze, something that holded me back from trying it (it did work on a VM).</description>
