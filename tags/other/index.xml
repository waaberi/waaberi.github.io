      <description>Brave is a popular chromium based browser made by Brendan Eich (co-founder of Firefox) that is open source. Brave comes built-in with an ad blocker, and because of that, it&amp;rsquo;s faster than Chrome. Many people like it, but should you use it? That is the question i will try to answer.
Good stuff Brave blocks ads, and upgrades your connection to HTTPS when it can. This makes it better than typical browsers such as Chrome for privacy.</description>
