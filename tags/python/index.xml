      <description>Both languages are very good, but what should you use for what, and why? That&amp;rsquo;s what i will be discussing in this post. I&amp;rsquo;d like to thank ZaphireHacks for bringing this up, i already had this debate before, but i think it&amp;rsquo;s important to have it again.
I will be rating JS and Python with 3 points, which are:
 Performance Functionality and Difficulty  First, i think it&amp;rsquo;s important to define what we mean by Python and JavaScript, because for some points, the language itself can&amp;rsquo;t just define that because there are multiple implementations.</description>
