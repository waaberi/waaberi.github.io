## Background

I'm a **first-year Software Engineering student** at the University of Ottawa, driven by curiosity and a passion for solving complex problems through code. I started my journey in tech through programming and cybersecurity competitions, which taught me to think critically and act fast.

## What I'm good at

### Full-Stack Development
Building end-to-end applications with modern web technologies. From React frontends to FastAPI & Express backends, I love creating polished user experiences backed by solid architecture.

**Tech stack:** React, Next.js, FastAPI, Flask, Django, PostgreSQL, Docker

### Cybersecurity
I have hands-on experience in penetration testing and vulnerability assessment. As a Cybersecurity Analyst during High School, I discovered critical vulnerabilities and built tools for security testing. I've also participated in competitions such as CyberSci where I ranked in the top 10 individually for the Ottawa region.

**Skills:** Burp Suite, ZAP, Kali Linux, Pwntools

## Experience Highlights

### Cybersecurity Analyst @ De La Salle HS (Nov 2024 - Jan 2025)
Found **2 critical vulnerabilities** affecting all network-connected systems and led the patch rollout. Built 4 automation tools in Python, Go, C++, and C# for security testing.

### CS Tutor & Coding Club President (Sep 2023 - Jun 2025)
Founded and led a computer science club where I ran **44 sessions** and tutored **47 students**. Created 20+ pages of reusable documentation for future students.

### Coco Z - Developer (Oct 2020 - Jan 2023)
Monetized a desktop application that reached **1.5M downloads** and generated **$3,600 in annual revenue**. Part of a team of 6 and a Discord community of 5,000 users.
